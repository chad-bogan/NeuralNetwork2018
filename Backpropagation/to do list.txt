Get started.
Might reuse some of the code from the previous XOR network I hard-coded.
Using the sigmoid method is a must. >>>DONE
Code in momentum and learning rate. >>>DONE

date: November 30 2018
Write a method that does the Delta-weight function
Write a method that calculates the gradient
ONE GRADIENT FOR EACH WEIGHT IN THE NETWORK
Assign random values for the 9 weights >>>DONE

date: December 4 2018
Figure out what the desired outputs should be >>>DONE (0.223)
Calculate the error using MSE or something else idk lol >>>DONE
TO DO: CALCULATE THAT MF NODE DELTA AND GRADIENT. I WILL GIT-R-DONE NEXT TIME.

NOTES FOR 12/4
INPUT1 = 1
INPUT2 = 0
OUTPUT = .223
9 WEIGHTS

TRIAL ONE XOR
Hidden 1: -2.0
Hidden 1 out: 0.11920292202211757
Hidden 2: 8.0
Hidden 2 out: 0.9996646498695336
Output prelim:-4.713205431349907
Final output: 0.008896108487424847

TRIAL TWO XOR
Hidden 1: 4.0
Hidden 1 out: 0.9820137900379085
Hidden 2: 0.0
Hidden 2 out: 0.5
Output prelim:-12.928055160151633
Final output: 2.4289351923620684E-6

Made Feedforward calculation into its own method for convenience sake.
Calculate node delta >>>DONE

date: December 10 2018
calculate gradients >>>DONE

date: December 12 2018
I need to sum the gradients to do one big backbrop calculation.(Batch gradients)
Fixed random number generation on weights >>>DONE
Write backprop method >>>DONE

date: December 14 2018
I need to get everything within the while loop as to easily do multiple iterations.>>>DONE
										but I need to improve it further.
I'm working on it okay?

date: January 2 2019
I must at least get the outputs as they should be and how Kramer wants them. Output gradients and weights. Shouldn't be too hard. >>>DONE (kinda)

date: January 4 2019
Still figuring out the Node Deltas.

date: January 8 2019
Second to last class day before due date
Nearly implemented the backprop algorithm
The shit is printed correctly
Fixed ND and gradient calculations
Error still eludes me but alas
I think it is universal?
backprop for next time
maybe clean the lines up
they are quite messy

Backprop implemented???? >>>DONE?
we'll see

LAST CLASS BEFORE DUE DATE
Just wrapping things up
adding comments
striking out old code
I think it works fine
The code is janky as all hell.
